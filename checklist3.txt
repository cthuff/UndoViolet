Week 3

Functional specification (what the project will do) is complete: Ok

There is some design documentation (key classes, mechanisms, protocols): Ok

Work on that more next week.

There are sufficient issues to keep each team member busy for week 4: Partial

An issue should be assigned to a SINGLE PERSON and have a SHORT DURATION (< 3 days). You have unassigned issues.

I like the "Commit to the project" issue. Make one for Yuliang as well. If those aren't closed, it's clear who isn't doing anything.

Each team member has closed at least two issues and has put the closed issue number(s) in their report: No

No closed issues reported by Hengyi
Nothing at all from Yuliang and Qi. 

The project builds and does something useful. Put instructions for building and for trying out that useful feature on the wiki: No

I didn't see anything on the Wiki.
